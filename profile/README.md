# Peamo Network
Peamo is an open source Nintendo Network replacement that aims to build custom servers for the Wii U and 3DS family of consoles. Our goal is to preserve the online functionality of these consoles, to allow players to continue to play their favorite Wii U and 3DS games to their fullest capacity.
We are just Pretendo Network but all the beta servers are free*.
(*we're not affiliated with Pretendo Network. It was a comparison.)
